Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Project 1

## Motivation
The AirBnb data sets are very interesting. For this project, I chose to work with the Hong Kong data. It's a large data set and there were some challenges I had to overcome.

## Libraries
* Pandas was used strictly to manipulate the data.
* matplotlib 
* seaborn 
* datetime 

## Files 
* data/listings_summary.csv
* data/neighbourhoods.csv
* data/calendar.csv
* data/listings.csv
* data/reviews.csv

## Summary of the results of the analysis
